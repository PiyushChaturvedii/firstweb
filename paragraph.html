    <h1>My First ParaGraph</h1>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph of text that serves as an example of how to structure
      a simple HTML document. Paragraphs are used to separate blocks of text and
      make the content more readable. You can add more paragraphs by using the
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for each new block of text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another paragraph to demonstrate how multiple paragraphs can be
      included in a single HTML document. Each paragraph is enclosed within its
      own <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, allowing for clear separation of ideas
      and topics within the content.
